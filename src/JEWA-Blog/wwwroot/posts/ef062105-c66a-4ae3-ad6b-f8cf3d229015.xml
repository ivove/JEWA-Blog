	<title>Writing a blogging engine - The basics</title>
	<excerpt>
		The real base of any blog are the posts, without those it would not really be a blog. 
		To organize the blog categories are often used, so any post should belong to a category or multiple categories.
		Some blogs use tags to further organize the blog, or make searching the blog for a post easier. 
		Apart from the posts, visitors should be able to leave a comment on a post. This means a post could have comments attached to it. 
		Some blogs allow for replies to these comments, this is done to aid the discussion and to group comments belonging together.
